Unfortunately the Amazon Echo in the UK is a poor shadow of what you get in the US. In the US, you have access to a load of great Skills (apps) that aren't available to UK customers, like IFTTT integration and Harmony remote integration. In the US your echo can read Kindle books, but no such feature in the UK. In the US you can add any Alexa enabled device to your account, but in the UK you can't actually add the Tap device to your account. Basically, we are being sold the same hardware, for a higher cost than in the US, and being given less features.

The device has great potential, but Amazon has chosen not to enable those features for UK consumers. That's a real shame.
