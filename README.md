# Machine-Learning
A repo of all exercises from the first year Machine Learning and Real World Data course. 

This was an introductory course to machine learning and the main techniques we covered were:

- Na√Øve Bayes for classifying the sentiment of a movie review
- Hidden Markov Models for  analysing protiens to predict what parts of a protein are in a cell membrane
- Graph analysis to find nodes of interest in a social network

Alongside this, we also learnt about the best practices for training and evaluating a machine learning model. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this course and it inspired me to build `TwitterSim`, a Java application that, when given a public Twitter account, will generate tweets using a Hidden Markov Model in the same style as that user.
